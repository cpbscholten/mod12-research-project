% This is "bach-ref-2009.tex" Updated january 29th 2010.
% This file should be compiled with "sig-alternate-fixed.cls" January 2010.
% It is based on the ACM style "sig-alternate.cls"
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate-fixed.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to the Twente Student Conference on IT. Both this file as the 
% document class file are based upon ACM documents.
%
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line TSConIT
%       4) NO headers and/or footers
%
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

% This .tex source is an example which *does* use

% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,

\title{Hacking the router: characterizing attacks targeting low-cost routers using a honeypot router}
% In Bachelor Referaat at University of Twente the use of a subtitle is discouraged.
% \subtitle{[Instructions]}

%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

}
% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.
% author on the opening page (as the 'third row') but we ask,
% for aesthetic reasons that you place these 'additional authors'
% in the \additional authors block, viz.
% \additionalauthors{Additional authors: John Smith (The
% Th{\o}rv{\"a}ld Group, email: {\texttt{jsmith@affiliation.org}})
% and Julius P.~Kumquat (The Kumquat Consortium, email:

\begin{abstract}
In this paper hacker attacks against low-cost routers have been investigated with the goal to get a better understanding of the intents of hackers and to find ways to improve defense mechanisms for these devices. This has been achieved by characterizing and analyzing real hacker attacks performed against a honeypot router device in a cloud environment. RouterOS from MikroTik has been run in a cloud environment as a honeypot to capture hacker attacks. Using this environment, multiple attacks have been discovered, including traffic related to CVE-2018-14847, which contributed 71.1\% of all traffic on MikroTik specific port 8291. Some successful DNS redirection attempts were discovered and attacks were received that managed to reboot the honeypot router by sending one or multiple RST packets.

%ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
% \section{Acknowledgments}

% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{ieeetr}
\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
%
% \vspace{50 mm}
% \newpage
%APPENDICES are optional
% \appendix
% Appendix A
% \section{Headings in Appendices}
% The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for the body
% of the article are different in the appendices. In the
% \textbf{appendix} environment, the command \textbf{section} is
% used to indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
% designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and a title
% (if you include one).  So, if you need hierarchical structure
% \textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
% highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this document in
% Appendix-appropriate form:
% \subsection{Introduction}
% \subsection{The Body of the Paper}
% \subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
% \subsubsection{Math Equations}
% \paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% \paragraph{Display Equations}
% \subsubsection{Citations}
% \subsubsection{Tables}
% \subsubsection{Figures}
% \subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
% \subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
% \subsection{Conclusions}
% \subsection{Acknowledgments}
% \subsection{Additional Authors}
% This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it. You just
% add the names and information in the
% \texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start of the
% document.
% \subsection{References}
% Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex, then bibtex,
% then latex twice (to resolve references) to create the ~.bbl file.
% Insert that ~.bbl file into the .tex source file and comment out
% the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
% % This next section command marks the start of
% % Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
% \section{More Help for the Hardy}
% The sig-alternate.cls file itself is chock-full of succinct and
% helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
% experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading it
% useful but please remember not to change it.
