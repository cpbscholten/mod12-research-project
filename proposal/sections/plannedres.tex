To answer the research questions, the research will deliver the following results:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An overview of the different types of attacks low cost routers are vulnerable to.
    \item An overview of which of the attacks can be mapped and for each of these attacks a methodology for mapping them.
    \item An evaluation of real hacker attacks performed on the honeypot device and a characterization of these attacks to discover the intent of hackers and proper defense mechanisms against attacks on low cost routers.
\end{enumerate}
